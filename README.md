# CS-135-Virtual-Reality-Prototype
***This project was made for CS 135: Virtual Reality in Spring 2021 at the University of California, Riverside***

## Description
A small Unity application made as a keyboard-and-mouse, first person prototype of what could be a virtual reality experience. This academic quarter occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic and access to VR equipment was unavailable at the time of development due to social isolation. So the emphasis of this project was to prototype something that would be fun in virtual reality and that I could demo on mouse and keyboard.

The gameplay consists of using a first person controller to navigate a castle setting with various interactive elements in the environment.

### Controls
- ***WASD*** : to move 
- ***Mouse*** : to rotate the camera
- ***E*** : to interact with objects in the environment
- ***TAB + Right-click*** : to drop torches
- ***Space*** : to jump

### Mechanics / Takeaways
The major mechanics and things I learned to work with in this game:
- Interacting with objects (grabbing torches, grabbing and swinging doors and bricks)
- Depth of field and motion blur effects applied to the camera for realism
- Self-made animations for the knight, made in Blender
- Interactable torches that douse when touched to water (water in the basement, rain particles) and can be relit by touching them to other torches
- Semi-functional particle system for rain and mist when you exit the castle
- Specular and normal map usage for convincing environment textures

## Demo
A link to a very short demo video recorded at the time of the class, showing off most of the level: https://youtu.be/E7p4S7Z8oec

## Planned Updates
- Record new gameplay demo video
- Clean up main scripts and file naming schemes for assets 
- Finishing the basement and roof levels
- Cleaning up the overall visuals (missing textures and animations, poorly formatted textures, empty rooms need more items and ambience, etc)
- Implement missing functionality (the ladder, the knight following the player, etc)
- Clean up all major bugs
