# CS-135-Virtual-Reality-Prototype
***This project was made for CS 135: Virtual Reality in Spring 2021 at the University of California, Riverside***

## Description
A small Unity application made as a keyboard-and-mouse, first person prototype of what could be a virtual reality experience. This academic quarter occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic and access to VR equipment was unavailable at the time of development due to social isolation. So the emphasis of this project was to prototype something that would be fun in virtual reality and that I could demo on mouse and keyboard.

Thie contents of the project include using a first person controller to navigate a castle setting using the mouse for camera movement and the ***WASD*** keys for player movement.
