# CS-135-Virtual-Reality-Prototype
***This project was made for CS 135: Virtual Reality in Spring 2021 at the University of California, Riverside***

## Description
A small Unity application made as a keyboard-and-mouse, first person prototype of what could be a virtual reality experience. This academic quarter occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic and access to VR equipment was unavailable at the time of development due to social isolation. So the emphasis of this project was to prototype something that would be fun in virtual reality and that I could demo on mouse and keyboard.

The gameplay consists of using a first person controller to navigate a castle setting with various interactive elements in the environment.

### Controls
- ***WASD*** : to move 
- ***Mouse*** : to rotate the camera
- ***E*** : to interact with objects in the environment
- ***TAB + Right-click*** : to drop torches

## Planned Updates
- Clean up main scripts and file naming schemes for assets 
- Finishing the basement and roof levels
- Cleaning up the overall visuals (missing textures and animations, poorly formatted textures, empty rooms need more items and ambience, etc)
- Implement missing functionality (the ladder, the knight following the player, etc)
- Clean up all major bugs
